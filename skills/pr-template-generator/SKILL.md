## PR Description Templates

### Feature Addition Template

```markdown
## Summary

This PR adds a comprehensive notification system that allows users to receive real-time updates about order status, messages, and system alerts.

## Motivation

**Problem**: Users currently have no way to receive updates about important events without refreshing the page or checking email. This leads to delayed responses and poor user experience.

**Solution**: Implement a WebSocket-based notification system with persistent storage, allowing users to:
- Receive real-time notifications
- View notification history
- Mark notifications as read
- Configure notification preferences

## Changes

### Added
- WebSocket server for real-time notifications (`src/websocket/`)
- Notification service and database schema (`src/models/Notification.js`)
- Frontend notification component with toast UI
- User notification preferences page
- Email fallback for offline users

### Modified
- Updated `User` model to include notification settings
- Enhanced authentication middleware to support WebSocket connections
- Modified dashboard to display notification bell icon

### Removed
- Old polling-based notification checker (deprecated)

## Technical Details

### Architecture
```
Client (React) <--WebSocket--> Server (Node.js) <--> Redis Pub/Sub <--> Database
```

### Key Implementation Decisions
1. **WebSocket vs. Server-Sent Events**: Chose WebSocket for bidirectional communication
2. **Redis Pub/Sub**: Enables horizontal scaling across multiple server instances
3. **Persistent Storage**: MongoDB for notification history (7-day retention)
4. **Email Fallback**: Queue-based email notifications for offline users

### Database Schema
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  type: String,           // 'order', 'message', 'system'
  title: String,
  message: String,
  data: Object,           // Type-specific payload
  read: Boolean,
  createdAt: Date,
  expiresAt: Date        // TTL index for auto-cleanup
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- [x] Notification service (create, mark read, delete)
- [x] WebSocket connection handling
- [x] User preferences validation
- [x] Email fallback queue

### Integration Tests
- [x] End-to-end notification flow
- [x] Real-time delivery verification
- [x] Reconnection after disconnect
- [x] Multi-device synchronization

### Manual Testing

## Performance Impact

- WebSocket connection: ~5KB per user
- Redis memory: ~1MB per 10,000 notifications
- Database: 200 writes/sec tested (current load: 10/sec)
- Client bundle: +15KB gzipped

## Breaking Changes

None - This is a new feature with no breaking changes to existing APIs.

## Migration Guide

No migration needed. New notifications table will be created automatically via migration:

```bash
npm run migrate:latest
```

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- Redis server required (update docker-compose.yml included)
- Environment variables (see `.env.example`)
- Run database migration before deployment

### Configuration
```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
WEBSOCKET_PORT=3001
NOTIFICATION_RETENTION_DAYS=7
EMAIL_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true
```

### Rollout Strategy
1. Deploy Redis infrastructure
2. Run database migrations
3. Deploy backend (rolling deployment)
4. Deploy frontend (feature flag enabled)
5. Monitor error rates and WebSocket connections
6. Gradual rollout: 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% over 3 days

### Bug Fix Template

```markdown
## Summary

Fixes a critical bug where users were unable to submit orders when using discount codes that exceeded the order total, resulting in negative final amounts.

## Issue

**Bug Description**: When users applied discount codes worth more than their cart total, the checkout process would fail silently, leaving users unable to complete their purchase.

**Impact**:
- Severity: HIGH
- Affected Users: ~500 users/day
- Revenue Impact: Estimated $2,000/day in lost sales
- First Reported: 2024-01-10
- Browser: All browsers
- Environment: Production only

**Error Message**:
```
ValidationError: Order total cannot be negative
  at OrderService.validate (src/services/OrderService.js:45)
```

## Root Cause

The discount validation logic in `OrderService.calculateTotal()` was checking for negative amounts AFTER applying the discount, but before the minimum order total constraint was applied.

```javascript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (Buggy Code)
const subtotal = calculateSubtotal(items);
const discountAmount = calculateDiscount(subtotal, discountCode);
const total = subtotal - discountAmount;

if (total < 0) {
  throw new ValidationError('Order total cannot be negative');
}

// Minimum order total check never reached
```

The issue occurred because:
1. Discount validation happened in wrong order
2. No cap on discount amount vs. order total
3. Frontend didn't validate before submission
4. Error message wasn't user-friendly

## Solution

### Backend Changes

```javascript
// ‚úÖ AFTER (Fixed Code)
const subtotal = calculateSubtotal(items);
const discountAmount = calculateDiscount(subtotal, discountCode);

// Cap discount at subtotal amount
const cappedDiscount = Math.min(discountAmount, subtotal);
const total = Math.max(subtotal - cappedDiscount, 0);

// Ensure minimum order value if needed
if (total > 0 && total < MINIMUM_ORDER_TOTAL) {
  throw new ValidationError(
    `Order total must be at least $${MINIMUM_ORDER_TOTAL}`
  );
}
```

### Frontend Changes

Added client-side validation to prevent invalid submissions:
- Check discount vs. cart total before submission
- Display warning when discount exceeds total
- Show final amount preview
- Improved error messaging

## Testing

### Reproduction Steps (Before Fix)
1. Add item to cart ($10)
2. Apply discount code worth $15
3. Proceed to checkout
4. Click "Place Order"
5. ‚ùå Order fails with validation error

### Verification Steps (After Fix)
1. Add item to cart ($10)
2. Apply discount code worth $15
3. ‚úÖ Discount capped at $10 (free order)
4. Proceed to checkout
5. ‚úÖ Order succeeds with $0 total

### Test Cases Added

```javascript
describe('Order Discount Validation', () => {
  it('should cap discount at subtotal amount', () => {
    const order = { subtotal: 50, discount: 75 };
    const total = calculateTotal(order);
    expect(total).toBe(0);
  });

  it('should allow discounts equal to subtotal', () => {
    const order = { subtotal: 100, discount: 100 };
    const total = calculateTotal(order);
    expect(total).toBe(0);
  });

  it('should apply partial discounts correctly', () => {
    const order = { subtotal: 100, discount: 25 };
    const total = calculateTotal(order);
    expect(total).toBe(75);
  });

  it('should handle percentage discounts', () => {
    const order = { subtotal: 100, discountPercent: 150 };
    const total = calculateTotal(order);
    expect(total).toBe(0); // Capped at 100%
  });
});
```

### Regression Testing
- [x] Normal discount codes (under total)
- [x] Exact match discount codes
- [x] Excessive discount codes (over total)
- [x] Multiple discount codes
- [x] Expired discount codes
- [x] Invalid discount codes

```

### Refactoring Template

```markdown
## Summary

Refactors the payment processing module to improve code maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns. No functional changes or breaking changes.

## Motivation

The current payment processing code has become difficult to maintain due to:
- Multiple payment providers mixed in single file (~1,200 lines)
- Tight coupling between business logic and provider APIs
- Difficult to test (requires mocking multiple external services)
- Code duplication across payment methods
- Hard to add new payment providers

**Technical Debt**: This refactoring addresses item #45 in our technical debt register.

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Extract provider-specific logic
2. **Testability**: Enable mocking and unit testing
3. **Maintainability**: Reduce file size and complexity
4. **Extensibility**: Make adding new providers easier
5. **Type Safety**: Add TypeScript interfaces

## Changes Overview

### Before (Problematic Structure)
```

          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PayPalProvider.test.js
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SquareProvider.test.js
```

## Technical Details

### Payment Provider Interface

```typescript
interface PaymentProvider {
  // Provider identification
  readonly name: string;
  readonly supportedCurrencies: string[];

  // Core payment operations
  createPaymentIntent(amount: number, currency: string, metadata?: object): Promise<PaymentIntent>;
  capturePayment(paymentId: string): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  refundPayment(paymentId: string, amount?: number): Promise<RefundResult>;

  // Customer management
  createCustomer(customerData: CustomerData): Promise<Customer>;
  attachPaymentMethod(customerId: string, paymentMethodId: string): Promise<void>;

  // Webhooks
  verifyWebhookSignature(payload: string, signature: string): boolean;
  handleWebhookEvent(event: WebhookEvent): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Refactored Service Layer

```javascript
// ‚úÖ AFTER: Clean orchestration
class PaymentService {
  constructor() {
    this.providers = {
      stripe: new StripeProvider(config.stripe),
      paypal: new PayPalProvider(config.paypal),
      square: new SquareProvider(config.square)
    };
  }

  async processPayment(orderId, paymentMethod, amount, currency) {
    const provider = this.getProvider(paymentMethod);

    try {
      // Business logic
      const order = await this.validateOrder(orderId);
      const convertedAmount = await this.convertCurrency(amount, currency);

      // Delegate to provider
      const result = await provider.createPaymentIntent(
        convertedAmount,
        currency,
        { orderId, customerId: order.customerId }
      );

      // Store transaction
      await this.saveTransaction(orderId, result);

      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      await this.handlePaymentError(error, orderId);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  getProvider(method) {
    const provider = this.providers[method];
    if (!provider) {
      throw new Error(`Unsupported payment method: ${method}`);
    }
    return provider;
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### Improved Testability

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Easy to mock providers
describe('PaymentService', () => {
  it('should process payment with selected provider', async () => {
    const mockProvider = {
      createPaymentIntent: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: '123' })
    };

    const service = new PaymentService();
    service.providers.stripe = mockProvider;

    await service.processPayment('order-1', 'stripe', 100, 'USD');

    expect(mockProvider.createPaymentIntent).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      100,
      'USD',
      expect.objectContaining({ orderId: 'order-1' })
    );
  });
});
```

### Reduced Complexity

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | 45 | 8 | 82% ‚Üì |
| Lines of Code (main file) | 1,200 | 200 | 83% ‚Üì |
| Test Coverage | 45% | 87% | 93% ‚Üë |
| Number of Files | 1 | 12 | Better organization |

### Easier to Extend

Adding a new payment provider now requires:

```javascript
// 1. Create new provider class
class NewProvider implements PaymentProvider {
  // Implement interface methods
}

// 2. Register in service
this.providers.newprovider = new NewProvider(config);

// That's it! No changes to existing code.
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage

- [x] All existing tests still passing (100% backwards compatible)
- [x] New unit tests for each provider (87% coverage)

## Migration Notes

### Backwards Compatibility

‚úÖ **100% backwards compatible**

All existing API interfaces remain unchanged:
```javascript
// Old code still works
paymentService.processPayment(orderId, 'stripe', 100, 'USD');
```

### Database Changes

None required - this is purely code reorganization.

### Configuration Changes

Optional: New config structure (old structure still supported):

```javascript
// New recommended structure
{
  payment: {
    providers: {
      stripe: { apiKey: '...', webhookSecret: '...' },
      paypal: { clientId: '...', clientSecret: '...' },
      square: { accessToken: '...', locationId: '...' }
    }
  }
}
```
